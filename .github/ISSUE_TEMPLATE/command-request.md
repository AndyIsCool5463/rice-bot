**Why should this be added?**
Let us know why this should be considered and added. (ex. This command will let users *do this* or *do that*!)

**How should we implement this?**
Letting us know what it does alone won't help us aid the command progression at all. Explain to us how this command can be made into a command (ex. when the user types in the word foo. it output bar).
> You can also use an ordered list to organize your thoughts.
